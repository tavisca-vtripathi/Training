<h1>Templar v1.7 - Overview Document</h1>
<h2>What is Templar?</h2>
<p>Templar is a framework for building highly customizable and reusable web applications.
Templar works on the concept of widgets, which are the building blocks for creating web sites.
It’s very easy to create widgets. Once created, these widgets can be quickly customized and reused for different display and functional settings. 
Templar admin application provides full management interface for building and managing websites with widgets. Developing a website using Templar is a drag-drop designer based experience.
Templar users can manage and change the look and feel of websites by</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing themes,</li>
<li>Using multi-language support,</li>
<li>Customizing layouts,</li>
<li>Managing site versions,
And many such features that come out of the box.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key features of Templar</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ability to build and manage highly dynamic ecommerce sites, such as full blown travel websites.</li>
<li>Ability to run multiple sites on a single instance, with multi domain support.</li>
<li>Easy internalization with multi language &amp; currency support.</li>
<li>High level of customization with ability to configure every aspect of a website.</li>
<li>Out of the box support for pages to be served on SSL, SEO and page routing configurations.</li>
<li>Highly flexible mechanism for passing data between widgets, whether the widgets are on the same webpage or on different webpages. Highly scalable with inbuilt support for web farm deployment and distributed caching.</li>
<li>Easy to deploy websites across environments.</li>
<li>User management with high level of security and inbuilt access control.</li>
<li>Audit log capabilities to see all changes made via APIs or the admin application.</li>
<li>Strong isolation of live and current view with ability to preview and compare versions. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Terminology</h2>
<h3>Widget</h3>
<p>A widget is a web application which can be used across websites and web pages. It can be as simple as an ad banner which shows an image and its related message or as complex as a fully working application like an email client which provides features like Yahoo or Google mail. Widgets can be creating using HTML/JavaScript/CSS or they may also include server side code.</p>
<h3>Page</h3>
<p>A standard web page or document is referred to as a page in Templar. All Templar pages follow some layout and would have widgets added in them. Templar allows various configurations for serving pages such as http only (unsecure), https only (secure) or allow both http and https access. 
Based on their settings pages can be classified under following types</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Page:</strong> These are the standard type of pages as described above.</li>
<li><strong>Default page:</strong> one page of the site can be made as the default page. This is the page which is shown when a request is made for the site without specifying any specific page.</li>
<li><strong>Login page:</strong> In case of a password protected website, this is the page where users would be redirected for login before accessing protected pages.</li>
<li><strong>Master page</strong>-this type of page allows a user to select widgets and place holders to create a consistent layout for a set of pages in your application. Other pages called content pages can set this page as their master page or parent and get the same layout and widgets automatically. </li>
<li><strong>Content page</strong>-pages which have a master page as their parent are called content pages. These inherit the layout and widgets from their master page. New widgets can be added to these pages where available placeholders are available in the master page. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>The visual look and feel of a site is controlled by a theme. It includes standard CSS, images, media and other files as used in web development. Themes are kept standard so as to avoid any learning curve for designer or developers creating them. When a theme is applied to a site, Templar includes a reference to all CSS files in the Theme folder in all pages of the site. In case a theme folder has multiple CSS files, Templar ensures that the files are lined in an alphabetical order based on folder level. Templar allows two types of themes </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Site level themes</strong> – which can only be used in the site they are created in.</li>
<li><strong>Global themes</strong> –which can be shared across multiple sites. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>The default display of a Templar page is controlled by the layout. By default, a page is made up of three areas- header, content and footer. The content area can be sub divided into one, two or three columns. All content sections can be further customized at page level.
<img src="./images/1.TemplarOverviewDocument/1.Layout.png" /> </p>
<h3>Custom layout</h3>
<p>This feature allows custom page layouts to be created and used in Templar pages. This is a powerful feature when it comes to designing sites based on unique layout requirements and with all the benefits of master pages, themes, widget reuse and other Templar capabilities.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>Culture is a way for website and\or widget to adopt its content to a specific country and\or language. A single instance of culture has format settings such as date, time, currency and number formatting information. A culture would also have translated language content and resources like images, media and other files for a particular country and\or language setting. </p>
<h3>Template</h3>
<p>Templar has a mechanism to create a package of a site with all its content like settings, pages, themes, and resources. This package is called a template. A template can be used to create site backup for comparison with an existing site or for copying a site from one environment to another.  A template contains information about global resources like global culture, global themes and widgets but does not contain their content.</p>
<h3>Site</h3>
<p>A site is a made up of one or more pages.  Sites can have multiple themes associated with it, with one being the default. (Templar users can also set the site culture settings and have appropriate globalization data for internalization of their content. Sites can also contain resources such as files, text and images, which can also be exposed publically based on permissions. </p>

<h2>FAQ’s</h2>
<h3>How can I backup my Templar site?</h3>
<p>Templar provides Templates which contain backup of a full site with all its contents.  It includes pages, site settings, site resources, themes and site specific globalization data. Besides this you will need to create a backup of any global cultures and themes if used in your site. The widgets settings can be saved using download widget option but manual backup is needed for widget code. </p>
<h3>Is there a way to automate Templar site releases across environments?</h3>
<p>Yes this can be done using the deployment service which allows creating new sites, updating existing sites from a template or over the web and also publishing sites. It also allows management of global culture and themes for deployment purposes. Widget related settings can be automated using the widget management service. All non-code changes can be propagated via this approach.</p>
<h3>What technologies should I know to create Templar sites?</h3>
<p>At a basic level you only need to know HTML/CSS/JavaScript for creating sites. However if you are an ASP.NET developer than you can even create widgets, depending on your requirement and use the full power of ASP.NET 4.5 that you are familiar with. </p>
